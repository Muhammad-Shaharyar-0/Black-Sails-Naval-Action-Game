****** !!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!! ******
------------------------------------

Since Unity project settings don't seem to get included in the package, you need to unzip the
contents of the LibraryAssets.zip file into the project's Library folder (overwriting what's there).
Without this the game will not function properly as certain tags will be missing.
